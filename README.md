- [ ] Fine-tune the model
- [ ] Model packaging (serialisation, containerisation)
- [ ] Choose deployment strategy (cloud or local) and interaction type (API, **webapp**, cli, embedded systems)
- [ ] Build + deploy the webapp
- [ ] Deploy the model (one-off)
- [ ] Add output text size control feature
- [ ] Add context area for user defined personalisations
- [ ] Add support for pdf (and other) files (multimodality)
